# EX 12 C program to check whether the given number is prime or not using function without return type and with arguments.
## DATE: 
## AIM:
To write a C program to check whether the given number is prime or not using function without return type and with arguments.

## Algorithm
   
1. Start
2. Declare the variable i.
3. Read the value given using scanf.
4. Check whether the given number is prime or not using if-else statement condition.
5. If true,print ("%d is a prime number.",i).
6. If false, print ("%d is not a prime number.",i).
7. End.
   
## Program:
```

int main()
{
int i; 
scanf("%d",&i);
if(i%2==1 && i%1==0)
{
printf("%d is a prime number.",i);
}
else
{
printf("%d is not a prime number.",i);
}
return 0;
} 

```
